## Welcome to Chris B. learning dbt!

If you're reading this, stay awake for a few more lines while I explain what I'm doing here.

### I'm using the dbt starter project

- I'm using the dbt CLI for everything and editing in Sublime text on Mac OS. 
- I'm using the `dbt-bigquery` implementation linked to my personal __GCP__ account.
